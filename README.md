# Climo Studios CSS Library

## The #1 small developer library

## What is this?
This was made for the Climo Studios group so that we could have a very specific CSS library to work with. As we work with small groups and clients using a huge library was not appealing to us as collective so we are working on our own and thought we would release it to the public as a helpful free tool and so that maybe the other developers out there could help out.

### Navgation Guide
```
    <div class="navBarContainer">
      <span>
        <a href="#">Home</a>
        <a href="#">About</a>
        <a href="#">Etc</a>
      </span>
    </div>
```
Simply we make a div and add the class of "navbarContainer". Next we can optionally add a span or just add a tags into the nav the span is there so we can right & center align the nav items.
Editorial: Image/Logo support coming soon.
